## 🔥 Deflationary Mechanism

CubeCoin includes a burn function and cooldown logic to support long-term deflation.  
Tokens may be burned via governance proposals or automated triggers to reduce supply and increase resilience.

## 🛡️ Governance & Control

All minting, pausing, and burning permissions are assigned to governance contracts via `TimelockController`.  
No externally owned account (EOA) holds sensitive roles.
