# 🧱 Cube Ecosystem – Official Page

Welcome to the official page of **CubeCoin**, a meaning-driven token ecosystem built on the Polygon (MATIC) network.

Cube is more than a token—it is a system of meaning, resilience, and trust. Every contract, role, and transfer is designed to preserve autonomy and prepare for gradual decentralization.

## 🛡️ Governance & Philosophy

Cube uses `TimelockController` to enforce delayed execution and decentralized control. All sensitive roles are revoked from EOAs and assigned to governance contracts.

Cube is stewarded with presence, documented for community, and protected for the future.
