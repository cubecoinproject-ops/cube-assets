## 🛡️ Security & Governance

Cube implements multi-tiered access control and timelock governance:

- Role-based permissions (`MINTER_ROLE`, `PAUSER_ROLE`, `PROPOSER_ROLE`)  
- Transfer limits and cooldown protection  
- Emergency pause functionality  
- Delayed execution for critical operations  
- DAO-ready architecture with operational stewards onboarded

## 🧠 Philosophy

Cube is more than a token—it’s a system of meaning, resilience, and trust. Every contract, role, and transfer is designed to preserve autonomy and prepare for gradual decentralization. The ecosystem is stewarded with presence, documented for community, and protected for the future.
